# py3sc32
A Python3 Version of the pysc32 python3 module.  Communicate with your Lynxmotion SSC32 board with Python3!

# Overview
For convenient interfacing with the Lynxmotion SSC32 board, a python 2 module exists, here:
https://pypi.org/project/pyssc32/

Unfortunately, it looks like support for Python3 is currently unavailable.  I've made modifications and tested them to verify Python3 support for my projects.

# Installation
For now, just copy the *.py files into your Site-Packages library folder under a folder called ssc32.
